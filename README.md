[Ð¢he game! :star: ](https://daniilryabkov.github.io/Snake/)


#### Viewed from a top-down perspective, each player controls a "snake" with a fixed starting position.
The "head" of the snake continually moves forward, unable to stop, growing ever longer.
It must be steered left, right, up, and down to avoid hitting walls and the body of either snake.
